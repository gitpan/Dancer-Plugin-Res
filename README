NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Res - Syntax sugar for setting the status and returning
    a response

VERSION
    version 0.0002

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer;
        use Dancer::Plugin::Res;
        post '/widgets' => sub {
            return res 400 => to_json { err => 'name is required' }
                unless param 'name';
            # ...
            return res 201 => to_json { widget => $widget };
        };
        dance;

DESCRIPTION
    This Dancer plugin provides the keyword "res()", which stands for
    response. It allows you to set the response and return a body in one
    shot.

        return res 400, { msg => reason };

    is equivalent to:

        status 400;
        return { msg => reason };

    I made this plugin because I wanted a function like send_error() for
    ReST applications that return things like json instead of html.
    "send_error "reason ...", 500" will not always render the first argument
    you give it in the response. When your app is running in production
    mode, it will attempt to render a generic 500.html page. Which is great
    for front-end things, but not for back-end code where you always want
    your application to render the thing that you told it to render.
