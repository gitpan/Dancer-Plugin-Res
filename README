NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::Res - Syntax sugar for setting the status and returning
    a response

VERSION
    version 0.0003

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer;
        use Dancer::Plugin::Res;
        post '/widgets' => sub {
            return res 400 => to_json { err => 'name is required' }
                unless param 'name';
            # ...
            return res 201 => to_json { widget => $widget };
        };
        dance;

DESCRIPTION
    This Dancer plugin provides the keyword "res()", which stands for
    response. It allows you to set the response and return a body in one
    shot.

        return res 400, { msg => reason };

    is equivalent to:

        status 400;
        return { msg => reason };

    I made this plugin because I wanted a function like send_error() that
    behaved more consistently. "send_error("reason ...", 500)" will not
    always render the first argument you give it in the response. When your
    app is running in production mode with "show_errors" set to false, it
    will attempt to render a generic 500.html page. This is great for
    front-end only applications, but not for creating an api where you
    always want your application to render the thing that you told it to
    render.

FUNCTIONS
  res
        res($status, [$reason])

    Sets the status to $status and returns $reason. If $reason is not
    provided, returns an empty string.
